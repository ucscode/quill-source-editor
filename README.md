# Quill Source Editor
Inline source code editing module for Quill.js editor

Quill Source Editor is a versatile module that allows users to switch between normal view and code view. With just a click of a button, users can see the HTML code behind their content and make any necessary edits. This is particularly useful for users who want to see the markup of their content or make advanced edits.

The module uses CodeJar, a lightweight and customizable code editor, to render the HTML code in real-time. This means that users can see the changes they make to the code as they type, and easily switch back to normal view to see the final result.

Quill Source Editor is a module that adds a button to the Quill toolbar, allowing users to switch between normal view and code view. This feature provides users with the ability to analyze the HTML markup behind their content, make direct changes to the code, and see the new result immediately.

# Why use Quill Source Editor?

Quill Source Editor is useful for several reasons. One of the most important is that it allows users to edit the HTML code behind their content directly. For example, Quill Image uses data URL to render images, which can be quite long and space-consuming because it's encoded in base64. If you have multiple images, this can affect the performance of the website when the content is rendered in front-end. With Quill Source Editor, you can replace the data URL with a regular HTTP URL that points to an image and also add specific attributes like width="100%" since Quill does not directly allow resizing of images.
